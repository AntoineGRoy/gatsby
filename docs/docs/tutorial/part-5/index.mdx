## Tranformer plugins

// insert graphic of data layer with transform nodes

<Announcement>

(It's called a transformer plugin, but it's not actually changing the original nodes. It creates new nodes based on the originals, but with different data fields. You can see fields from the original node in the `parent` field.)

</Announcement>

In this part of the Tutorial, you'll learn how to use a transformer plugin to create MDX nodes from your File nodes.

## ?

```

Write a query to get your Markdown content:

```graphql

Sort posts by date

<Collapsible>

GraphQL fields with arguments

Sorting fields

</Collapsible>

**Ship It!** ðŸš€

Before you move on, deploy your changes to your live site on Gatsby Cloud so that you can share your progress!

First, run the following commands in a terminal to push your changes to your GitHub repository. (Make sure you're in the top-level directory for your Gatsby site!)

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Finished Gatsby Tutorial Part 5"
git push
```

Once your changes have been pushed to GitHub, Gatsby Cloud should notice the update and rebuild and deploy the latest version of your site. (It may take a few minutes for your changes to be reflected on the live site. Watch your build's progress from your [Gatsby Cloud dashboard](/dashboard/?utm_campaign=tutorial).)
